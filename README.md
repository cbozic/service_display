# service_display
A frontend to facilitate displaying streamed service videos to groups of remote viewers

TODO:
* Popout fullscreen behavior is still buggy
* Vertically center the background video
* Default all non-main youtube players to a lower resolution
* Correct the names of the components to match current state
* Hosted build
* Possible server component to allow centralized configuration
* In the piano, add startAt setting for each key because not every key starts at the same time
* In the piano, remove the delay in initialization now that the component is behind the background music player
* Audio nudge
