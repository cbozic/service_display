# service_display
A browser based application to facilitate displaying streamed service videos to groups of remote viewers

TODO:
* Easy Mode by default (see plan below)
* Hosted build on github
* Fix YouTube video id settings
* Correct the names of the component files to match current state
* Popout fullscreen behavior is still buggy
* Possible server component to allow centralized configuration
* In the piano, add startAt setting for each key because not every key starts at the same time
* Audio nudge


Plan for Easy Mode
* Default to fullscreen
* Default to start at the beginning of the stream
* Default state of video is
* load default slides on start
* transition slides by default
* main video paused by default
* PiP auto start and end (set with configurable but default values)
*
